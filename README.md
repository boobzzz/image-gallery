# Unsplash gallery

Two screens simple gallery with React Native

## Task description

Implement gallery with React-Native (not React.js), which would display photos
from the Unsplash API (https://api.unsplash.com). Fetched data should be in JSON format.  

The app should contain two screens (pages):  
#### Screen 1 - List of photos
- small size pic with the name and the author
- when user taps the list item, app switches to Screen 2, and a full sized pic is displayed
#### Screen 2 - Full screen photo
- displays a full size photo with the maximum size.  

It would be preferable to initialize the app with React Native CLI by means of - react-native init TestApp, rather than - create-react-native-app, if your machine's resources allow to do that.
